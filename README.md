This library supports an asynchronous background search for journey plans through Mileus, with the base use case of commuting home from the user's current location.

Please see the [Watchdog search docs](https://docs.mileus.com/watchdog-search/) for more details about the functionality, or the [SDK docs](https://docs.mileus.com/watchdog-search/frontend-integration/sdk/ios/) for more details about the usage of this SDK.

## Requirements
- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### Carthage
```
github "mileus/watchdog-sdk-ios" ~> 2.1.0
```

### Cocoapods
```
pod 'MileusWatchdogKit', '~> 2.1.0'
```

### Swift Package Manager
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mileus/watchdog-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.1.0"))
]
```

## Configuration
First you need to configure Mileus SDK in your `AppDelegate.application(:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
``` swift
MileusWatchdogKit.configure(
    partnerName: String, // Unique partner identifier
    accessToken: String, // Token from Watchdog Auth API
    environment: MileusWatchdogEnvironment // Environment type (staging or production)
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.invalidInput) if partnerName or accessToken is an empty string
```

## Migration
### 1.0.2 -> 2.1.0
#### Mileus Watchdog Search
Update location methods have been replaced with one universal method:
``` swift
// 1.0.2
func updateOrigin(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
func updateDestination(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)

// 2.0.0
func update(location: MileusWatchdogLocation, type: MileusWatchdogSearchType)
func update(searchData: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
```

#### Mileus Watchdog Search Data
This structure has been changed to be universal. We removed origin a destination attributes and added universal location attribute.
``` swift
// 1.0.2
struct MileusWatchdogSearchData {
    let type: MileusWatchdogSearchType
    let origin: MileusWatchdogLocation
    let destination: MileusWatchdogLocation
}

// 2.0.0
struct MileusWatchdogSearchData {
    let type: MileusWatchdogSearchType
    let location: MileusWatchdogLocation
}
```

## Usage

### Start Mileus Watchdog screen
This is a universal entry point in Mileus Watchdog. Use it to initialise new search, as well as opening Mileus Watchdog from notification.

You have to keep a reference to `mileusWatchdogSearch` instance as long as you need it.
``` swift
let mileusWatchdogSearch = MileusWatchdogSearch(
    delegate: MileusWatchdogSearchFlowDelegate,
    origin: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil, 
    destination: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil 
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.instanceAlreadyExists) if you have already created an instance or exception (MileusWatchdogError.sdkIsNotInitialized) if you have not initialized sdk yet.
```

Show Mileus Watchdog screen:
``` swift
let mileusVC = mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from: UIViewController)
```

#### Search Flow Delegate
Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.
``` swift
protocol MileusWatchdogSearchFlowDelegate {
    func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch, showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
    func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch, with error: MileusWatchdogError)
}
```

#### Search for origin or destination
``` swift
func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch, showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
```

When it is called you should open your search view controller.

Update origin or destination according to userâ€™s choice:

``` swift
mileusWatchdogSearch.update(location: MileusWatchdogLocation, type: MileusWatchdogSearchType)
```
or
```
mileusWatchdogSearch.update(searchData: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
```

#### Open taxi ride Activity
``` swift
func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

When it is called you should open your taxi ride view controller.

#### Open taxi ride and finish
``` swift
func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

When it is called you should close `mileusVC` and open your taxi ride view controller.
You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from:)`.

#### Finish
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogSearch)
```

You are responsible for closing `mileusVC`. You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusWatchdogSearch.show(from:)`.

### Start Mileus One Time Seach screen
Special entry point for one time search. You only need to init Mileus SDK and use one of the following methods to open the one time search. You should not open one time search if backend is not ready.

You have to keep a reference to `mileusOneTimeSearch` instance as long as you need it.
``` swift
let mileusOneTimeSearch = MileusOneTimeSearch(
    delegate: MileusOneTimeSearchFlowDelegate, explanationDialogKey: String)
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.instanceAlreadyExists) if you have already created an instance or exception (MileusWatchdogError.sdkIsNotInitialized) if you have not initialized sdk yet.
```

Show Mileus One Time Search screen:
``` swift
let mileusVC = mileusOneTimeSearch.show(from: UIViewController)
```

#### One Time Search Flow Delegate
Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.

``` swift
protocol MileusOneTimeSearchFlowDelegate {
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusOneTimeSearch)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusOneTimeSearch, with error: MileusWatchdogError)
    func mileusShowTaxiRide(_ mileus: MileusOneTimeSearch)
    func mileusShowTaxiRideAndFinish(_ mileus: MileusOneTimeSearch)
}
```

#### Finish
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusOneTimeSearch)
```

You are responsible for closing `mileusVC`. You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusOneTimeSearch.show(from:)`.


#### Finish with Error
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusMarketValidation, with error: MileusWatchdogError)
```

You are responsible to never trigger this call. You receive error with message why error has occured. 


### Start Mileus Market Validation screen
Special entry point for market validation purposes. In this mode no callbacks are called. You only need to init Mileus SDK and use one of the following methods to open the market validation screen. 

You have to keep a reference to `mileusMarketValidation` instance as long as you need it.
``` swift
let mileusMarketValidation = MileusMarketValidation(
    delegate: MileusMarketValidationFlowDelegate,
    origin: MileusWatchdogLocation, 
    destination: MileusWatchdogLocation 
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.instanceAlreadyExists) if you have already created an instance or exception (MileusWatchdogError.sdkIsNotInitialized) if you have not initialized sdk yet.
```

Show Mileus Market Validation screen:
``` swift
let mileusVC = mileusMarketValidation.show(from: UIViewController)
```

#### Market Validation Flow Delegate
Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.

``` swift
protocol MileusMarketValidationFlowDelegate {
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusMarketValidation)
}
```

#### Finish
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusMarketValidation)
```

You are responsible for closing `mileusVC`. You get `mileusVC` after calling `mileusMarketValidation.show(from:)`.

### Start Mileus Watchdog Scheduling screen
This is an entry point for opening the screen for scheduling watchdogs. Use it to open Watchdog Scheduling from your user interface, as well as for opening Watchdog Scheduling from notification. You can optionally pass the home location which will be used as the destination, if your app allows choosing one; otherwise the feature itself will allow the user to choose it. It will only be used as the default value, the user can still pick a different one within the feature.

You have to keep a reference to mileusScheduler instance as long as you need it.
``` swift
let mileusScheduler = MileusWatchdogScheduler(
	delegate: MileusMarketValidationFlowDelegate,
    homeLocation: MileusWatchdogLocation? = nil
) // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.instanceAlreadyExists) if you have already created an instance or exception (MileusWatchdogError.sdkIsNotInitialized) if you have not initialized sdk yet or (MileusWatchdogError.insufficientLocationPermission) if the app does not have sufficient location permissions.
```

Show Mileus Watchdog Scheduling screen:
``` swift
let mileusSchedulerVC = mileusScheduler.show(from: UIViewController)
```

#### Watchdog Scheduling Flow Delegate
Methods of Flow Delegate are always called on the main thread.

``` swift
protocol MileusWatchdogSchedulerFlowDelegate {
    func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogScheduler, 
        	     showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
    func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogScheduler)
}
```


#### Search for origin or destination
``` swift
func mileus(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogScheduler, showSearch data: MileusWatchdogSearchData)
```

When it is called you should open your search view controller.

Update home location:

``` swift
mileusSchedulerVC.updateHome(location: MileusWatchdogLocation)
```

#### Finish
``` swift
func mileusDidFinish(_ mileus: MileusWatchdogScheduler)
```

### Background Location Sync
We use a foreground service to initiate the synchronization of the user's location when the scheduled watchdog is about to start. Call this method to start the service. Get the appropriate location permission from a user before calling this method. Moreover, make sure that you have set the location permission text in Info.plist before calling it, otherwise your app will crash:

``` swift
let locationSync = MileusWatchdogLocationSync() // throws exception (MileusWatchdogError.insufficientLocationPermission) if the app does not have sufficient location permissions.

locationSync.start(completion:)
```

### Styling
When you call show(from:) method it returns UINavigationController. You have full access to UIKit elements such as navigationBar or navigationItem and so on. Feel free to customize it as you need. 

If you change or remove something from a navigation item, such as bar buttons or title, you are responsible for this change and the UI of the SDK does not have to work properly after this change.

Example:
``` swift
let navigationController = show(from: yourCurrentViewController)
// Transparent bar background colour
navigationController.navigationBar.backgroundColor = .red 
// Solid bar background colour
navigationController.navigationBar.barTintColor = .green
// Bar buttons colour
navigationController.navigationBar.tintColor = .blue
// Title font and colour
navigationController.navigationBar.titleTextAttributes = 
[
NSAttributedString.Key.font : UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18.0),
	NSAttributedString.Key.foregroundColor : UIColor.orange
]
```
